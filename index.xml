&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-land-and-ecosystems-account:54049ca00c09602b7b492d17f6f590a5&#34;&gt;What is a land and ecosystems account?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Land and Ecosystems account is a framework that determines the current status of the different eco-regions of Guatemala in physical terms and quantifies the rate of their use through an analysis of land use change and its effects on forest cover. Furthermore, it identifies the economic stakeholders that drive those changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eco-regions are relatively large portions of the local landscape that hold specific arrangements of natural resources and species with limits that are close to the original extension of those arrangements prior to human intervention. In Guatemala, there are 14 of these regions and two of them represent 71% of the country&amp;rsquo;s area. These are Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz (44%) and Pine-Oak forests of Central América (27%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-we-say-about-the-current-status-of-land-use-in-those-regions:54049ca00c09602b7b492d17f6f590a5&#34;&gt;What can we say about the current status of land use in those regions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forest cover reached 4.2 million hectares in 2003, which was about 39% of the country&amp;rsquo;s area. Conversely, land used for agriculture represented about 28% of the territory, and a combination of pastures, grasslands, shrubs and bushes took up about 31%. The distribution of the different land uses within the eco-regions was highly irregular, and it is noteworthy that over 30% of the total area was destined for perennial and annual crops in 7 of the 14 regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are large differences between regions. For example, the Yucatán Rainforest region had a forest cover of almost 78% in 2003, while the Dry forests of Central America had only about a 2% forest cover. Only five of the regions had a forest cover larger than the national mean, which revolved around 39%. These were the Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz (55%), the Rainforests of Yucatán (78%), &lt;strong&gt;Bosques montanos de Centroamérica&lt;/strong&gt; (42%),
Belicean Cost Mangroves (60%), and Northern Honduras Dry Mangroves (50%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--**[Figure 3. Land use in Eco-regions of Guatemala (2003)]**--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area with more agricultural activity in detriment of the forest cover is the Pacific Basin. There are 1.48 million hectares under cultivation. This is 61% of its surface area and almost half of all agricultural land in the country (49.4%). Its forest cover represents only 12% of its area. In contrast, the Gulf of Mexico Basin has a forest cover of 49% of its surface area (about 2.5 million hectares of forests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--**[Figure 4. Land use in Guatemala by Basin (2003)]**--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-have-forests-changed:54049ca00c09602b7b492d17f6f590a5&#34;&gt;How have forests changed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to understanding the current forest cover of a territory, it is illustrative to see how the forest has degraded over a certain period. In order to achieve this, we compare and contrast maps of forest cover built from satellite images. These maps require the work of several technicians from several institutions working together, and for this reason these maps are only published every few years. At the time of this comparison, only maps from 1991 and 2003 were available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guatemala lost 880,220 hectares of forest cover between 1991 and 2003, which represented a rate of deforestation of 17.3% for the entire period, relative to the forest cover in the first year. The main affected areas were the Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz with 540,215 hectares of forest cover lost, and the Pine-Oak Forests of Central America with 192,628 hectares. These regions accounted for 82% of all deforestation in those years. However, the Dry Forests of Central America region saw a most alarming rate of deforestation of 44%. At that pace, forest cover in that region could not last more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--**[Figure 5. Evolution of forest cover between 1991 and 2003]**--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-these-eco-regions-capable-of-producing-environmental-services:54049ca00c09602b7b492d17f6f590a5&#34;&gt;Are these eco-regions capable of producing environmental services?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the health of an ecosystem is a difficult task given the complexities of natural interactions. Nevertheless, there were indicators that we could use as proxies for ecosystem well-being. In that sense we evaluated forest density, forest fragmentation, and ecological integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forest density&lt;/strong&gt; measures spatially the existence of forest cover in every square kilometer. The more dense a forest, the better its ecological integrity. The data showed that Guatemala&amp;rsquo;s more dense forests&amp;ndash;especially those with densities higher than 60%&amp;ndash;, lost relevant portions of forest cover. The Gulf of Mexico Basin shows the most losses, with reductions of over 20%. Those area categories with no forest cover and those with densities lower than 40% showed increases of over 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forest fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt; measure the size of continuous blocks of forests and classifies them in 5 size categories. Between 1991 and 2001 four blocks of the larger categories (50,000 to 150,000 hectares) disapeared in the North of Guatemala, resulting in isolated areas of the 10,000 to 50,000 size category. In the South of the country, fragments were determined to be of the 0.5 to 2,000 hectare size predominantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecological integrity&lt;/strong&gt; is a measure that we were able to infer from the two measures previously explained. This showed that nine out of fourteen eco-regions do not possess the minimum connectivity and fragment size required to guarantee the provision of environmental services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eco-regions with less than 10% forest cover showed the most ecological integrity problems, all of them located in the Pacific Basin. These were the Dry Forests of Central America, RaiRainforests of the Chiapas Sierra Madre and the Pacific Coast Dry North Mangroves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were, however, three regions with fragments large enough to guarantee a minimum ecological integrity, with a surface of 1.4 million hectares, equivalent to 13% of the country&amp;rsquo;s area. These were located in three eco-regions: Rainforest of Petén-Veracruz, Bosque Montano de Centroamérica, and Belicean Cost Mangroves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--**[Table 1. Evolution of forest density between 1991 and 2001]**--&gt;

&lt;!--**[Figure 6. Evolution of forest fragments between 1991 and 2001]**--&gt;

&lt;!--**[Figure 7. Forest fragments with ecological integrity (2003)]**--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-drives-the-changes:54049ca00c09602b7b492d17f6f590a5&#34;&gt;What drives the changes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 73% of the 880,200 hectares that lost their forest cover between 1991 and 2003 became lands for agricultural uses. This is consistent with the transformation of 642,424 hectares of forest to annual and perennial crops (133,230 hectares), shrubs and bushes (289,133 hectares), and pastures (133,230 hectares). About 80% of forests from Arbustal espinoso del Valle del Motagua, Rainforests of the Chiapas Sierra Madre, Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz, and Dry Forests of Central America, changed to either crops, shrubs, bushes, or pastures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--**[Table 2. Changes in forest cover and other uses in hectares between 1991 and 2003]**--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-economic-costs-of-the-degradation:54049ca00c09602b7b492d17f6f590a5&#34;&gt;What are the economic costs of the degradation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the loss of two environmental services in order to determine effects of the degradation of forests. On the one hand we assessed the loss of the ability of forests to control erosion, and on the other we studied their capacity to store carbon. Our data showed that losses regarding these factors were equivalent to Q2,919.4 million  (about $374.3 million) between 1991 and 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deforestation in the various regions resulted in the loss of 15 million tons of soil in the form of erosion, equivalent to Q1,150 million (about $147.4 million). We obtained these numbers from the loss of macro-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphor, and potassium) in every ton of eroded soil, depending to its category. Regions with the most losses were Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz (Q.733.5 million or $94 million), and Pine-Oak Forests of Central America (Q.237.3 million or $30.4 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the loss of forest cover, 368,622,243 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were released into the atmosphere, with at total cost of Q.1,769.4 million (about $226.8 million) at international carbon market prices. Of these losses, 85% can be attributed to the loss of forest cover in the Rainforests of Petén-Veracruz and the Pine-Oak Forests of Central America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-agriculture-forestry-and-fisheries-account:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;What is an Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries account?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (SEEA AFF) is a framework that describes the relationship between the environment and the economy with an emphasis on agriculture, forestry and fisheries (FAO, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it allows us to determine the level of stocks that are present in the production, processing and consumption of food, and other environmental services ascribed to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. It also tracks the flows of natural inputs between the environment and the economy, as well as within the economy of these and other sectors. Finally, it also reflects environmental degradation that can occur from these exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-what-kind-of-information-does-it-contain:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;And what kind of information does it contain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEEA AFF aims to keep track of the following data domains and base accounts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agricultural products and related environmental assets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for crops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for livestock products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for livestock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for plantation crops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forestry products and related environmental assets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for timber and non-wood forest products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for forests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for timber resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fisheries products and related environmental assets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for fish and aquatic products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for fish and other aquatic resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water resources

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for water resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for water abstraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for water distribution and use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for energy use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for GHG emissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fertilizers, nutrient flows and pesticides
*Physical flow account for fertilizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nitrogen and phosphorous budgets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical flow account for pesticides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for land use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for land cover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soil resources

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset account for soil resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other economic data

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetary supply and use table for agricultural, forestry and fisheries products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extended production and income account for agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;has-it-already-been-done-for-guatemala:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;Has it already been done for Guatemala?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have conducted a trial run of SEEA AFF in Guatemala with the existing information of the SEEA Central Framework already present for 2010 in order to assess what was possible and identify information gaps that need to be worked on in more detail. Nonetheless, some of the preliminary findings are already revealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-we-know-about-crops-then:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;What do we know about crops then?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, table 1 shows the output and import of various crops in metric tons for Guatemala in 2010. In terms of volume, sugar cane was by far the largest output of this group of products, followed by the production of bananas and maize. But if we were to take out sugar cane and bananas from this comparison because of their highly industrialized nature geared towards exports, we could quickly see that maize took up a third of the remaining products combined supply. Maize was followed closely by the group called &amp;ldquo;other vegetables&amp;rdquo; with a share of output of 16% and &amp;ldquo;other fruits and nuts&amp;rdquo; with 12% of this more limited group (without sugar cane and bananas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting to see that the production of beans, which are a staple food for Guatemalans, was not as large in terms of volume as that of maize. It represented 5% of total supply, which was comparable to wheat (6%), potatoes (6%), and other seeds and oily fruits (5%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external dependency of several products is also noteworthy. For example, most wheat was imported (99.7%). Also, 70% of unprocessed rice came from imports also. As much as maize has been a part of the Guatemalan diet for centuries, about 21% of it was imported. And even if supply of soy might not be important in terms of volume, a third of it came from imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 1. Physical supply account for crops. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of use of the same products, we grouped economic activities in a way that would make it more easy to identify the steps of the food production chain. For that reason, we have industries that use crops as seed inputs, others that use it as feed for animals, we have the industrial production of food, hotels and restaurants, the remaining industries of Guatemala, households and exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grouping industries that would naturally use crops as feed had the intention of addressing the concern of large portions of the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface being cleared for the production of animal feed. Table 2 shows that the largest users of agricultural supply were manufactures, households, and the rest of the world (exports); not industries for feed. It would be reasonable to think that grain would be used by manufactures for the production of animal foods, but as we&amp;rsquo;ll see volumes of those products were not relevant in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 2. Physical use account for crops. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of &amp;ldquo;soy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;other live plants, flowers, and seeds,&amp;rdquo; the data revealed no use as feed, but an important share of their volume was used as seed (40% and 38% of all uses, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-important-is-the-food-processing-industry:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;How important is the food processing industry?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the products with larger volumes in the economy, it is interesting to recognize the share used by manufacturing industries at the national level. For example, in the case of maize, only 20% of all used volume had a final destination in manufacturing. This is consistent with the 80% (adjusted to extract the negative stock variation) that was consumed by households. It contrasts with the 99% of the supply of unprocessed rice and wheat that were used almost exclusively by the food processing industries. This does not mean that households didn&amp;rsquo;t consume such products. It only means that they got them in their processed versions, such as precooked white rice and dehydrated breakfast gruel. For this reason, the totality of sugar cane was used by the food processing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from these exceptions, households did consume large volumes of cultivated products directly, which is consistent with the traditional market culture still present in most of the country. For example, they used 95% of beans, 88% of potatoes, 97% of other roots and tubers, 99% of fresh culinary herbs, 91% of other vegetables and 67% of all fruits, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 4. Supply of processed foods. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take note of the relative importance in terms of volume of fruit juices (52,897 tm), other bakery and pastry products (44,885 tm), preserves, fruit marmalades, purees and fruit pastes (31,592 tm), as well as prepared or canned legumes (35,039 tm). It is noteworthy that in this last category we can find canned refried beans which are increasingly popular in Guatemalan diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrative as the supply of foods is in understanding food security topics, evaluating the use of those foods within the economy has more explanatory power. Table 5 shows that households consume about 23% of the volume of prepared legumes, while 68% becomes exports, and it also shows that they use about 73% of canned fruits. It is also relevant that only 36% of processed rice goes to households, while 62% becomes exports. Households also use about 20% of wheat flour and 60% of other types of flour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 5. Use of processed foods. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-we-know-about-water-and-energy-use-in-this-context:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;What do we know about water and energy use in this context?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring food production requires that we ensure water availability during the various stages of crop growth. Table 6 shows the different requirements of land and water for crops. Among uses of water it is important to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed agriculture. In the first case, producers must make sure that there is enough available water of quality for crops to grow. In the second case, producers depend on the availability of rain water, the hydrological cycle, and climate variability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 6. Crops land and water use. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maize production, as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in volumetric terms before, is highly important to Guatemalans. It represents also the largest water use among crops (4.8 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which is comparable to sugar cane production. Nonetheless, the water used for the production of this crop comes exclusively from rain (rainfed agriculture). This is also the case for the production of beans whose water use reaches 0.9 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, sugar cane has also a total water use of 4.8 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is, however, a more industrialized production which uses several methods of water use: 56% rainfed, 24% aspersion, 17% gravity, and 3% other methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other relevant uses of water correspond with palm oil tree production (2.9 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 52% of which come from irrigation), coffe (2.6 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, all rainfed agriculture) and bananas (1.4 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 63% of which comes from irrigation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 7 shows the use of energy of various sources in Guatemala. It is interesting that agricultural production, which does use a certain amount of gasoline and diesel, only represents about 1% of total energy use in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more relevant to note that households use about 40% of the country&amp;rsquo;s total energy use in the form of fuelwood. Judging by the 1% of total energy use that represent household gas or electricity use, it is implied that the main method of cooking in Guatemala is fuelwood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 7. Energy use. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-with-fertilizers-and-nutrients-in-guatemala:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;What happens with fertilizers and nutrients in Guatemala?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical work on the use of fertilizers is at a very early stage in Guatemala and so it can be complicated to supply information in the format proposed by the manual. However there are some estimations by FAO. For them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fertilizer consumption measures the quantity of plant nutrients used per unit of arable land. Fertilizer products cover nitrogenous, potash, and phosphate fertilizers (including ground rock phosphate). Traditional nutrients&amp;ndash;animal and plant manures&amp;ndash;are not included. For the purpose of data dissemination, FAO has adopted the concept of a calendar year (January to December). Some countries compile fertilizer data on a calendar year basis, while others are on a split-year basis. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.&amp;rdquo; (FAO 2016)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 8 shows a time series of this indicator for the years 2002-2013. We see a growing trend, going from 189 kilograms per hectare in 2010 and reaching 256 kg/ha in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 8. Fertilizer consumption. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little data regarding nutrients and waste in the Guatemalan SEEA. Under other efforts, there is a food balance sheet developed by the National Institute of Statistics for the year 2013, and even if it is impractical to reproduce it here, it is important to note that it has information on internal availability; losses and wastes; internal use; available food per year in metric tons; and supply of food and nutrients per inhabitant for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cereals;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legumes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sugars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tubers and roots;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vegetables;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fruits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meats;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eggs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fish and seafood;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dairy products;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oils and fats;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fortified foods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 shows the evolution of the availability of daily calories per capita from vegetal and animal sources. In the years 2005-2013 87% of Guatemalans&amp;rsquo; caloric intake came from vegetal sources, and 13% from animal sources, in average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Figure 3. Total available calories. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-we-know-about-the-economics-of-it-all:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;What do we know about the economics of it all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 9 shows the contribution of the different agricultural products to Guatemalan output in monetary terms for the year 2010. As we can see, the production of crops contributed around 9% of gross production, while cattle farming about 2%; the same as other agricultural products, forestry, and fisheries combined (2%). In total, all this production represents about 12% of the value added by the entire economy that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 9. Total supply in monetary terms. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 10 shows the use of the same products in monetary terms. Households buy 59% of crops, 80% of other agricultural products, but only 19% of the production of cattle farming. For this last category, 80% is destined to intermediate consumption by other industries. As for fisheries, 42% of total output is bought by households, 37% becomes exports and 20% intermediate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 10. Total use in monetary terms. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now turn to extended production and income accounts for agricultural industries and the rest of the economy. Table 11 shows &amp;ldquo;taxes less subsidies&amp;rdquo; which represents monetary flows to the government in the form of taxes; net operating surplus, which collects profits from all companies; mixed income which is a mixture of self compensation and returns to capital of small business owners; compensation of employees; and value added, which is the total wealth generated by all economic activities in the accounting period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 11. Extended production accounts. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts:45af15fedfdd005d7e7870f81b067efc&#34;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen how the information readily available from the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts of Guatemala can be used to implement an Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries account as proposed by FAO to a certain extent. While there are still a number of aspect that need to be covered by Guatemalan statistical efforts, some of the findings of this pilot implementation are already revealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, it was interesting to learn that maize production in Guatemala depends entirely on rain water for its growth. This exposes the production of this crop to considerable risk in terms of climate variability, which contrasts with the fact that after sugar cane and bananas, maize is the largest production in terms of volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar argument can be made of beans, which also depend entirely on rain water. Beans cover a relevant portion of the Guatemalan diet, and it is interesting to see how canned legumes are increasingly used by households. This form of consumption of beans is ever more present in urban kitchens and it might represent a cultural shift that might increase the importance of industrial food processing in the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note the sheer amount of land used by maize and beans. Even if we have no land quality considerations in the data, the low yields of the lands used for these crops, coupled with lower levels of technical development and no irrigation provide an explanation to the considerable amounts of land used for their production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of products that have local markets are shown to be destined to the export market in their entirety. This might represent a compilation or estimation error. It is the case of vegetable oil, margarine, animal foods, bread, other bakery products, unrefined sugar from sugar cane, and molasses. Findings such as this one help improve the SEEA Central Framework of Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of energy, the most important finding is that while agricultural industries use negligible fractions of the total energy use of Guatemala (less than 1%), households do use about 40% of it in the form of fuelwood for cooking. Judging by the considerably less energy use of households in the form of liquefied gas and electricity, it is safe to imply that Guatemalan food is to a great extent cooked with fuelwood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-water-account-and-what-is-it-for:af8f8b90521da410b93191bf17464492&#34;&gt;What is a water account and what is it for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water account is a framework with which we describe the intricate relationships between the economy and water as a natural resource. With it, we link information on water sources with information about the various stakeholders in the economy, such as industries and consumers. More specifically, the water account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Records the availability of water in the country;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;records the different flows of water between the economy and the environment, and within the economy, between stakeholders;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes account of expenditures made in order to safeguard and restore water sources;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a set of indicators suited to monitor the environmental and economic performance of the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-general-trends-regarding-water-use-in-guatemala:af8f8b90521da410b93191bf17464492&#34;&gt;What are the general trends regarding water use in Guatemala?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first turn to the use of water, which we can understand as either consumption of water in processes that delay its return to the water cycle, such as household uses, industrial uses, and agricultural uses, as well as its use in processes that return it immediately, such as electricity generation. Figure 2 shows some variation in the use of water between 2001 and 2006 and results suggest that a slowdown of the production of coffee at the beginning of the decade might have contributed in a relevant manner to this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Figure 2. AD National water use with and without coffee processing (million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee processing industry is one of the largest users of water in Guatemala. In fact, next to the production of corn (which is highly dispersed among small landowners), coffee also is one of the crops that covers more surface area in the country. However, data from the National Coffee Producers Asociation (ANACAFE) show that coffee production, which reached close to 286 thousand metric tons in 2001, saw a 27% drop the following year, bouncing back in 2003, but stabilizing at a lower 204 metric tons for the remainder of the analysis period. Notwithstanding, if we remove the data corresponding to coffee from the series (which we can also see in figure 2), then the trend of water use by the remaining industries was of steady growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting indicator is that of water use per capita. This indicator links total water use to a population headcount for each year. Table 7 shows this indicator for our accounting years. It is evident that water use per capita reached its most significant number in 2006 with a total of 2,459 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per inhabitant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 7. AD National water use, population and water use per cápita ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 shows an erratic behavior in the use of water with a steady growth of 2.5% of the Guatemalan population. This suggest that population growth is a poor source of water use variation. If we don&amp;rsquo;t take into account the processing of coffee, water increased at a rate of between 4% and 7% between 2001 and 2006, a trend which is likely to continue in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Figure 3. AD Population and water use yearly growth rates in percentages.  ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-what-do-we-know-about-the-water-use-of-other-industries-and-final-consumers:af8f8b90521da410b93191bf17464492&#34;&gt;But, what do we know about the water use of other industries and final consumers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we first turn to the agricultural industries. In our analysis, we took into account the rain water that is used by crops in their different growth stages. This is called rainfed irrigation and we chose to include it because it reflects the real contribution of water to our economy in a better manner. Figure 4 shows the trend of the largest water using industries of Guatemala. As expected by the introduction above, rainfed agriculture is the largest individual water using industry, with a share of about 40% of total water use. It is followed by manufactures, which used between 35% and 24% in the accounting years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Figure 4. AD Shares of water use of selected industries.  ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity generated with hydraulic power gained importance in the accounting period, going from about 11% in 2001 to 15% of total water use in 2006. Converse to the figures presented before, irrigated agriculture represented about 10% of national water use in 2006, and about of 25% of the water used by all agriculture in general (about 4.3 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, households used less than 1.5% of total water use in Guatemala, and the remaining industries hovered around 3% and 4% annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we explained the total water used above includes rainfed water. However, there is also the concept of water extraction as that which derives water from an underground or surface source, and at the same time represents a consumption or severe change in its quality. This implies that neither hydroelectricity production or rainfed agriculture fit this description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 shows manufactures as the main extracting activities with a share of 62% of all extraction, which is estimated at 14,038 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Another important industry in this sense is irrigated agriculture, which was responsible for about 27% of total extraction in 2003. Coffee processing followed with 54% of extracted water, and sugar cane growing with about 12%. Households represented less than 3% of total water extraction in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Figure 5. AD Water extraction of selected industries.  ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-we-have-more-detailed-information-on-agricultural-uses-of-water:af8f8b90521da410b93191bf17464492&#34;&gt;Do we have more detailed information on agricultural uses of water?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, water used by different crops depends on the different water requirements of each cycle of plant growth, total cultivated area, total area under irrigation, and irrigation methods used. Table 8 shows estimates for the most important crops in Guatemala. This group represents about 87% of total water used by agriculture and 75% of the demand of water for irrigation in 2003. In this sense, sugar cane production stands out with 43% of total irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 8. AD Water used by the most important crops in Guatemala. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 6 shows the responsibility of different crops in the use of water, regardless of whether they are irrigated or not. It is evident that water is of extreme importance to food security (staple foods) and exports (sugar cane and coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 8. AD Water used by the most important crops in Guatemala. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-about-industrial-uses-of-water:af8f8b90521da410b93191bf17464492&#34;&gt;How about industrial uses of water?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing industries used around 8.7 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water in 2003. Table 9 shows selected industries with the largest uses. Once again, coffee processing stands out with an 87% share of all water used by manufactures (about 7.6 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Other important groups of manufacturing industries are food production and sugar production with around 8% and 2.5% of total water used by manufactures, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 9. AD Largest water uses among manufacturing industries. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-we-know-about-water-uses-of-other-economic-sectors-and-final-consumers:af8f8b90521da410b93191bf17464492&#34;&gt;What do we know about water uses of other economic sectors and final consumers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding other economic activities, it is important to point out that the third largest use of water in the country is electricity production. This industry may only use the water and not consume it, but its final product&amp;mdash;electricity&amp;mdash;makes a relevant contribution to the generation of wealth in the economy (or gross domestic product). In 2001 the share of total water use of electricity production was 11% and it grew to 15% towards the end of the analysis years; in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, water used to satisfy direct human needs represented around 3% of total extraction in the years 2001-2006. In 2003, total water used by households was estimated at 392.7 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We made this calculation taking into account that water use varies from urban to rural areas, from administrative region to region in the country, and also given different kinds of access to water of households. Table 10 shows these results by department. It is relevant that 59% of all household consumption of water happens in urban areas, and about a third of national household water is used in the department of Guatemala, which holds the capital city; the largest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 10. AD Household water use by department; urban and rural areas. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-this-information-different-from-what-we-already-know-from-national-accounts-and-other-sources:af8f8b90521da410b93191bf17464492&#34;&gt;How is this information different from what we already know from National Accounts and other sources?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, in the System of National Accounts only water that is subject to economic transactions is recorded, and given the institutional framework of water access in Guatemala, most water does not fit that category. Most rain water and water extracted from wells perforated by industrial activities is not subject of payments between economic stakeholders, and so they do not get captured by the system of national accounts. There is however an exception, and that is the small amount of water that is channeled through municipal or private distribution companies and which get charged to some connected households and small to medium enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our exercises already presented above we were able to compare and contrast the different volumes estimated by the System of National Accounts and water accounting. Figure 8 shows that upward of 98% of water is not registered by our usual economic performance measures. In 2006, this represented over 31 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Figure 8. AD Registered and Unregistered water in the System of National Accounts. ABOUT HERE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, table 11 shows these differences for selected individual industries. For example, in agriculture over 80% of unregistered water corresponds to rainfed agriculture, but the grand majority of water for irrigation is also excluded from typical gross domestic product calculations. And even for households, which are the main clients of private and municipal water distribution systems, registered water only accounts for about 20% of their total use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 11. Registered and unregistered water for selected industries. ABOUT HERE}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-the-environment-and-the-guatemalan-economy-in-a-nutshell:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Energy, the environment, and the Guatemalan economy in a nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;This text accompanies the Figure with the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature provides the Guatemalan economy with coal, wind, hydraulic and geothermal power, fuelwood, sugar cane bagasse, and crude oil, among others. These are called &amp;ldquo;primary sources&amp;rdquo; of energy because they are usable in its natural form to some extent. We can take advantage of them locally or we can import them from the rest of the world. However, most of the economy&amp;rsquo;s productive processes cannot take advantage of these sources in their raw form, and so they are transformed into what we call secondary sources of energy. Examples of this type of energy include the various types of gasolines and diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas, and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different industries, or economic activities, use both primary and secondary energy sources as inputs in their production processes. Households, in turn, use them to satisfy domestic needs like cooking, powering of devices, heating or cooling, among others. One special industry uses large amounts of various types of primary and secondary sources to produce electricity, which is then used universally by everyone else in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, from the combustion, or simply burning, of some these energy products, industries emit various gases that go up into the atmosphere. Some of these are known as greenhouse gases and in our accounting efforts we have tracked carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-energy-flow-from-the-environment-to-the-economy:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;How does energy flow from the environment to the economy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2001 and 2006, the Guatemalan economy used several types of energy resources directly from the environment in order to satisfy both the needs of industries and households. Water&amp;rsquo;s potential energy and thermal energy from volcanic activity were key resources in the production of electricity. The country also extracted crude oil and natural gas in some regions, which were destined almost exclusively for the export market. Guatemalans also imported coal from other countries mainly for the production of electricity. Nevertheless, in Guatemala the biggest source of energy obtained directly from the environment was biomass in the form of fuelwood for domestic use and sugarcane bagasse, mainly used as an input in the production of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the relative structure of energy sources that were used directly from nature in Guatemala in terajoules (TJ) between 2001 and 2006. This is called primary energy. It is evident that biomass was extremely important for the country, with a use share of around 83% of all primary energy sources. And within that category fuelwood powered household activities with 224,227.3 TJ or 90% of that biomass. The second most important source of primary energy was coal, which was used mainly for the production of electricity and was mostly imported. Hydraulic and geothermal energy were also important for the country with around 20,534 TJ used in the year 2006. Even if oil production in the country was important as a source of foreign income, its direct use in Guatemala was minimal, with a share of about 1% of primary resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 8, p. 30 AD, Primary energy]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-energy-move-within-the-economy:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;How does energy move within the economy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 483,947.3 TJ&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0:8&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of energy in all its forms was available to the Guatemalan economy in 2006. That energy was used as inputs in the production of goods and services by several industries, and also by households, the government, and non-profit institutions in processes such as cooking, artificial lighting, heating, or cooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure shows quantities of energy in terajoules used by the different economic industries and households in the rows, coming from the various energy sources in the columns. Darker tones represent higher uses of energy relative to total consumption. According to this, household final consumption of represented around 47% of total use and even surpassed slightly all consumption of energy used as inputs in production processes (46%). This was due not only to the fact that households were the main users of fuelwood (which has a high calorific content), but also of gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas for cooking, and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 9, p.31 AD, Energy use burden for Guatemala]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, table 10 shows the ten largest users of energy in 2006, excluding the use of fuelwood&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0:10&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The largest user of energy of all types in the Guatemalan economy was by far the production and distribution of electricity with a total of 61,594 TJ, equivalent to 27% of the energy used by industries as inputs in 2006. This meant that the Guatemalan society used a large percentage of energy of different kinds (such as coal, bunker, diesel, bagasse, etc.), which in many cases was imported at high costs, to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Notes on Greenhouse Gas Emissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total human contribution to greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of different energy sources in Guatemala amounted to 45.6 million carbon dioxide metric tons equivalent in 2006. In general terms, that was less than 1% of total world emissions. Nevertheless, it could still carry financial consequences or opportunities regarding international treaties on the matter. Table 11 shows the distribution of emissions among groups of economic industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 11, p.31 AD, Greenhouse Gas Emissions from energy combustion 2006]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we narrow the focus on individual activities Figure 4, shows the greenhouse gas emissions of the top five emitting industries on the left of the vertical axis with bars and those of households on the right of the vertical axis with a line. Households emissions were considerably higher, due to the high carbon content of fuelwood and their large use of that product, coupled with their considerable use of gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the top emitters, it is interesting to note that the emissions of the first economic industry on the bars (production and distribution of electricity) more than doubled those of its immediate follower. This was consistent with the high use of fossil fuels in the production of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second industry on the graph is the production of bread which is there because of its high use of fuelwood. In a GHG inventory (those advocated by the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change) emissions from biomass do not count toward the total emissions and are left as &amp;ldquo;memorandum items&amp;rdquo;, this in order to avoid double counting. In the supply and use accounting structure of the SEEA, this is not a problem, and hence they were included. If fuelwood and bagasse were excluded, bakeries and mills would exit this list and cement production and retail trade would replace them. Finally, due to its high use of different fuels, the transportation industry was also important in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-intensity:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Energy intensity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 shows an indicator called energy intensity for six economic industries for 2001-2006. Due to the nature of each type of economic activity, we can find these at different general levels of intensity. Some industries needed less energy to produce one unit of wealth added to the economy in that year (value added), like retail trade for example, and others, like cement production needed considerably more. For that reason it is not altogether adequate to compare intensities between industries. However, it is possible to compare how a specific industry fares through time. In that way, we can see if use of energy per unit of newly added wealth has improved or become worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Fig 5. p. 36, AD, Energy intensity for selected industries]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Guatemala, the production of bread showed a decrease in its intensity in the period. The production of ceramics showed a more erratic behavior, but mantained its high level of energy use, whereas transportation and general mills had a more stable energy intensity over time. This is probably due to the fact that technology is replaced less often in those activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-supply:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Energy supply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy supply for Guatemala in the period 2001-2006 was divided into eleven groups of energy commodities, which in turn can be divided into primary and secondary energy sources. These are shown in Table 1, where the largest supply of energy corresponds to fuelwood in caloric terms (about 46% of all energy use). The supply of refined products from oil represented around 30%, which came mostly from imports. Coal was imported in its entirety. Primary sources were the largest component, with 73% of total supply in 2001 and 65% in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 1, p.16, AD, Energy supply by energy commodity]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that table 2 shows that between 28% and 36% of total energy came from imports between 2001 and 2006, while the energy produced domestically saw its share reduced from 73% to 64% during the analysis period. This is consistent with a reduction of oil production in the country and an increase in relative terms of oil refined products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 2, p. 17, AD, Energy supply by groups of economic activity]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In monetary terms, the importance between primary and secondary sources was reversed, due to the higher unit price of electricity and imported refined products from oil when compared with fuelwood or bagasse. Secondary sources, in this case, represented 77% of all energy transactions in the economy in 2001 and 84% in 2006 (see table 3). Bagasse, which is a by product of the sugar cane milling process, was not valued in monetary terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 3, p.18, AD, Monetary supply]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-use:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Energy use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, energy use must be equal to its supply, and that means that the energy produced in the country must be used in its entirety by economic agents, either by industries, in final consumption, or as exports. The ability to disaggregate energy use by type of economic activity is one of the advantages of an energy account, because it allows us to track the economy&amp;rsquo;s energetic performance, but also the energy consumption of its individual agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guatemala consumed an average of 45,299.8 terajoules of energy in all its forms during 2001-2006 and the largest consumers of energy were households with a use of around 51% of available energy in 2001, and about 46% in 2006, especially for their use of fuelwood (see table 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 4, p.20, AD, Energy use in monetary terms]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, the group of economic activities labelled as manufactures consumed an average of 20% of the available energy annually, while the single utility sector of the economy in charge of the production of electricity consumed also an average of 20% of energy of all types. The transportation sector, which is the largest user of diesel fuel in the country, became a distant fourth place in this list. Overall, exports as a use category decreased in relative terms from representing 11% of total energy use in 2001 to 7% in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In monetary terms, the use of energy has a different behavior (see table 5). For example, in contrast with their use in calorific terms, their use in monetary terms was of approximately 29% of total energy use between 2001 and 2006. This is largely due to the fact that their largest energy input comes in the form of fuelwood, which has a lower value per unit than other energy types, and a large share comes from self extraction, not purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 5, p.21, AD, Energy use in monetary terms]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of largest consumers of energy commodities in monetary terms is headed by manufactures with an average of 22% annual use of the total energy available, followed by wholesale and retail trade with 10%. It is also interesting that in monetary terms, exports become more important, with about 9% of anual use in the 2001-2006 period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;greenhouse-gas-emissions:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Greenhouse Gas Emissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we established the use of energy by the different economic activities of Guatemala, a further step allowed us to estimate the greenhouse gasses that were emitted to the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of energy products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 6 shows these emissions both in metric tons, as well as in a unit which makes nitrous oxide and methane emissions equivalent to those of carbon dioxide. Given the high carbon content in fuelwood and its generalized use in Guatemala, households top the list of emitters with a responsibility of about 60% of all emissions in carbon dioxide tons equivalent in 2006 (over a 20 year horizon). Economic industries labelled manufactures were responsible of about 18% and the group of Utilities, where the production and distribution of electricity is included, was responsible for close to 13% of total emissions in that same year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-supply-and-use-tables:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Energy Supply and Use tables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was possible to construct for every year in the study a supply and use table with the information shown so far. These types of tables give us an overall view of energy flows for the entire country. The columns in this case show the different energy products, either offered by any of the economic activities in the rows, or used by them. Table 7 shows this in terajoules for 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Table 7, p. 24, AD, Supply and Use Tables for 2006 in terajoules]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;additional-indicators:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0&#34;&gt;Additional Indicators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information on flows allowed us to construct an indicator showing the intensity with which energy is used. This indicator measures how much energy is necessary to generate one unit of value added or newly generated wealth in that year. We saw some insights using this indicator in the discussion on energy intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also computed the decoupling indicator, a measure that measures the gap between the growth rate of energy consumption and the growth rate of the economy. In an ideal situation, the economy would grow infinitely, while the consumption of energy would decrease over time. This would mean that the country would be so efficient with its resources that it could produce more each year with the same consumption of energy as in the previous year, or have the same production, but with less energy. On an aggregate basis, the Guatemalan economy showed a clear example of decoupling where the economy grew at a much more rapid pace than that of its energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3cc96d9b80e0f953d1c554f50c09bdb0:10&#34;&gt;This is done for presentation purposes, given that fuelwood use dwarfs all other uses. Around 85% of fuelwood is used by households.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-we-doing-this:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Why are we doing this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of Synthesis Reports on the Guatemalan System of Environmental and Economic Accounts is the result of an effort to make its findings available to a broader non-Spanish speaking audience. The System includes information on energy, forests, water, ecosystems, waste, subsoil resources, fisheries, and environmental expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Synthesis Reports summarize three documents that were published in 2009 for each of the accounts&amp;ndash;one methodological, one of results, and one more informational&amp;ndash;by the Central Bank of Guatemala and Rafael Landívar University. We feel that even if a few years have gone by and the numbers have evolved, key insights that were made possible by the accounts regarding the relationship between the environment and the economy in Guatemala will be everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than translating these documents verbatim, we opted to slightly rewrite and reorganize their information having a general English reader in mind. This resulted in more concise documents with less of an academic tone, which policy makers and the general public will appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also tried to make them more suitable for the different ways in which people consume information. For that reason, each of the reports can be read online, downloaded as an e-book or PDF, or acquired in printed format.&lt;/p&gt;
