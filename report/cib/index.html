<h2 id="what-is-a-forest-account:4dda42dfb77a95d1a18af5a004b38b4a">What is a forest account?</h2>

<p>The forest account of Guatemala is a framework that explains the relationship between forests and the economy. It puts together information on the status of forests and economic transactions associated with them in a systematic manner. It reveals the real contribution of forests to the national economy and the possible impacts that the economy might have on the well-being of forests.</p>

<p>More specifically forest accounting measures the stocks of the national forest inventory and the flows associated with it; it identifies the industries and stakeholders that benefit directly or indirectly from forests; it records expenditures made by government institutions in order to mitigate damages to and restore the well-being of forests; and extend macro-economic aggregates and indicators in order to reflect the depreciation of the forest resources.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-status-of-forests-in-guatemala:4dda42dfb77a95d1a18af5a004b38b4a">What&rsquo;s the status of forests in Guatemala?</h2>

<p>In order to answer this question we turn to the change of forest land stock in comparison with 1970 and to an indicator of this change relative to population (forest land stock per capita). As for changes in land stock, by 2005 Guatemala had lost close to 40% of its 1970 availability. More illustrative is the fact that due to high population growth rates, availability of forests per capita have dropped in a relevant way.</p>

<!-- Figure 2 Land stock change from 1970 to 2005 (percentages, 1970=100) -->

<p>Another important indicator is the rate of deforestation, which helps to measure the impacts of government policies on sustainable resource use. In the case of Guatemala, absolute deforestation rates are stable between 60,000 and 70,000 hectares per year. This represents an annual stock loss of about 1.5% per year. The highest since 1950, and even greater than 1970s records, when population reallocation policies pushed for aggressive changes of forest land into agricultural land. That rate seems high when put in context with others from Latin America from the 1990-2000 decade, such as Brazil (0.4%), Bolivia (0.3%), Colombia (0.4%), Ecuador (1.2%), and Mexico (1.4%).</p>

<!-- Figure 3 Deforestation rates 1950-2005 (thousands of hectares and percentages of stock relative to the previous year) -->

<p>There are other causes of reduction of forest volume, such as timber and fuelwood selective extraction, de-branching, forest fires, plagues and diseases, as well as natural mortality. Uncontrolled logging and selective fuelwood extraction is one of the main reasons for forest volume reduction. By forest account estimates more than 95% of forest product flows in the country (30.7 million m<sup>3</sup>) happen outside the control of the forest government authorities (National Institute of Forests&mdash;INAB&mdash;and the National Council for Protected Areas&mdash;CONAP&mdash;). Forest accounting estimates attribute 76% of that uncontrolled forest use to fuelwood extraction and 24% to timber extraction. Up to two thirds of all timber processed by wood processing industries is estimated to come from uncontrolled sources.</p>

<p>The rise uncontrolled traffic of forest products is consistent with (i) a lack of institutional capabilities for control, (ii) an ineffective control system for the transportation of forest products, (iii) the lack of an effective transportation permit issuing system, (iv) obscure market practices that operate under the legal umbrella of family forest allowances, and (v) a lack of raw materials origin control within the wood processing industries.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-monetary-value-of-the-guatemalan-forests:4dda42dfb77a95d1a18af5a004b38b4a">What is the monetary value of the Guatemalan forests?</h2>

<p>The forest account assigned market valuations to standing timber between 2001-2006. In that period the value of forests went from 56,351.9 million quetzales (GTQ) to 83,467 million. This is a behavior more consistent with non-renewables than with renewable resources and hints that forests might be used unsustainably. Under sustainable practices, forest regeneration should provide constant availability at stable prices.</p>

<p>Even when valuating at constant prices of 2001, monetary values of forests increased in spite of the reduction of the forest stock, which was close to 76 million m<sup>3</sup> between 2001 and 2006.</p>

<!-- Figure 4 Forest volume and monetary value of forest assets for the years 2001-2006 (cubic metres and valuation at constant prices of 2001) -->

<p>If we contrast forest growth with reduction due to either controlled or uncontrolled logging, it is easy to see that the former does not compensate for the latter. In 2006, for example, that resulted in the loss (or net stock variation) of GTQ2,076 million. On the other hand, uncontrolled logging represented more than GTQ2 billion, which exceeds the value of controlled logging by far.</p>
